## Scope Update: Introducing `network_id`

ATN is evolving from a single local trust substrate into a Trust Network Engine.

To support future deployment modes (Solo, Private, Public Attestation Agency),
all core domain objects now include:

    network_id: string

This field namespaces all activity within a logical trust network.

Why this matters:

- Multiple isolated trust networks can run inside a single ATN instance.
- Jobs, agents, offers, and events cannot interact across networks.
- Future "virtual trust networks" can be hosted as separate network_id domains.
- Policy (membership, witness rules, quorum) can be applied per network.

Important:

- In V0.1, `network_id` defaults to "local".
- No policy enforcement changes yet.
- This is a structural foundation, not a behavioral change.

This prevents future data migration pain and enables:
- Self-hosted closed networks
- Hosted multi-tenant trust networks
- Public attestation agencies

All cryptographic invariants remain unchanged.
